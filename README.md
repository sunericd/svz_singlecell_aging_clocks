# svz_singlecell_aging_clocks
R scripts for running a leave-one-batch-out CV or leave-one-mouse-out CV elastic net regression prediction task on single-cell RNAseq data (e.g. training aging clocks and predicting ages for each cell). Also included are the EnsembleCell model scripts for training and transfer to other datasets.
